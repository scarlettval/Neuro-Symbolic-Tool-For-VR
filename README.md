# Neuro-Symbolic VR Tool

A cutting-edge **Virtual Reality** system that integrates **Neural Networks** and **Symbolic Reasoning** to create an intelligent, immersive experience on the **Meta Quest 2**. This tool leverages state-of-the-art **machine learning**, **Prolog-based symbolic logic**, and **speech recognition** to deliver adaptive, intuitive VR interactions. By combining learning-based approaches with explicit logic rules, it enables more transparent decision-making, real-time adaptability, and deeper user engagement.

## Features

- **Immersive VR**: Built for the **Meta Quest 2** using Unity’s XR toolkit (or Oculus Integration).  
- **Neural Network Module**: Implemented in Python (e.g., PyTorch), enabling:
  - Real-time **inference** and **dynamic retraining**.
  - Seamless data exchange with symbolic logic.
- **Symbolic Reasoning Module**: Uses **Prolog** (via [pyswip](https://github.com/yuce/pyswip)) to:
  - Embed logic rules that handle explicit knowledge and constraints.
  - Complement the neural network with explainable decision paths.
- **Speech Recognition**: Integrate with:
  - [PocketSphinx](https://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx) or
  - [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)
  - Extensible for other APIs (Google, Azure, etc.).
- **Intuitive UI**: VR-based user interface for effortless interactions and fast feedback loops.

## Architecture Overview

Below is a simplified representation of the **Neuro-Symbolic VR Tool** workflow:

     +---------------------+
     |   Voice Commands   |
     +---------------------+
               |
               v
+----------------------------------+ | Speech Recognition (Python) | +----------------------------------+ | ^ | (Text) | (Audio) v | +--------------------------------------------------+ | Neural Network (PyTorch) | | - Processes user context | | - Learns from VR interaction data | +--------------------------------------------------+ | ^ | (Refined data) | (Queries & feedback) v | +--------------------------------+ | Symbolic Reasoning (Prolog) | | - Validates logic & commands | | - Provides rule-based actions | +--------------------------------+ | v +-----------------------------+ | Unity VR Environment | | - Meta Quest 2 compatible | | - UI, 3D objects, scenes | +-----------------------------+


**Key Interaction Flow**:  
1. Voice input captured → **Speech Recognition** → textual commands  
2. Text commands → **Neural Network** to interpret user intent & context  
3. NN output queries/updates the **Symbolic Reasoning** module for logic consistency  
4. Combined output → **Unity VR** for real-time display & interactivity

## Project Structure

Typical layout (you can adapt to your needs):

neuro-symbolic-vr-tool/ ├── UnityProject/ │ ├── Assets/ │ ├── Packages/ │ ├── ProjectSettings/ │ └── (etc.) ├── prolog/ │ └── symbolic_rules.pl ├── python/ │ ├── main.py │ ├── network.py │ ├── speech_recognition.py │ └── ... ├── requirements.txt ├── .gitignore └── README.md <-- (You are here)



- **UnityProject/**: Contains all Unity assets, scenes, and project settings for VR development.  
- **prolog/**: Houses Prolog rule files and logic statements.  
- **python/**: Contains Python scripts for the neural network, speech recognition, and bridging code to Prolog.  
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies.  
- **.gitignore**: Ensures large or auto-generated files (e.g., Unity’s Library, Temp folders) are not committed.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/neuro-symbolic-vr-tool.git
   cd neuro-symbolic-vr-tool


2. **Unity Setup**

Install Unity Hub and add Android Build Support, OpenJDK, and the Oculus XR Plugin.
Open the UnityProject/ folder in Unity to load the project.
Python Environment

Install Python 3.9+ (3.10 recommended for broader compatibility).
Create and activate a virtual environment:
bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
Install dependencies:
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prolog Installation

Install SWI-Prolog.
Verify installation:
bash
Copy
Edit
swipl --version
Confirm Setup

In your activated Python environment:
bash
Copy
Edit
python -c "import torch; import pyswip; print('All good!')"
In Unity, under Build Settings ensure the platform is set to Android and in Project Settings → XR Plug-in Management confirm the Oculus plugin is enabled.
Usage
Prolog Logic

If you have logic files in prolog/symbolic_rules.pl, you can load them in SWI-Prolog or via pyswip.
Python Scripts

Speech Recognition (example):
bash
Copy
Edit
python python/speech_recognition.py
Neural Network:
bash
Copy
Edit
python python/network.py
Main Orchestration:
bash
Copy
Edit
python python/main.py
This may coordinate speech recognition → neural network → symbolic logic → VR commands.
Unity VR Testing

Open UnityProject/ in Unity.
Connect your Meta Quest 2 via USB (Developer Mode on).
Build and run to confirm everything deploys and works on the headset.
